"""Recall confirmation signal + CLS replay (nightly L4 boost) + L0 gate replay.

record_recall_useful: dream writes one audit_log row per recalled core fact
(action='recall_useful', target_id=str(entry_id)) — the frequency signal
consumed by ACT-R activation and ImportanceScheduler. Written directly to
audit_log (not via AuditTrail.log) so the signal survives even when the
audit_trail feature flag is off.
cls_replay: nightly 2nd phase — boosts facts confirmed by recall within the
window (Complementary Learning Systems: hippocampal replay consolidates
reactivated traces into neocortex).
replay (L0, Task F6): re-runs the G1 distiller over the l0_journal window.
Idempotency: each processed row records {'gate', 'config_hash', 'ts'} in its
decisions JSON; a row is skipped when the current config-hash is already
recorded for that gate. Rows reset to 'gated_out' (decisions cleared) are
re-processed.
